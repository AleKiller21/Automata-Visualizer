# Automata-Visualizer
Visualizer and editor made with JointJS and jQuery. Use it to try out different automata and context-free grammars.

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Evaluation of DFA, NFA, NFA-Epsilon, PDA, and Turing machine</li>
  <li>Union, Intersection and Complement of regular languages</li>
  <li>Conversion of DFA to regular expression</li>
  <li>Conversion of regular expression to NFA-Epsilon</li>
  <li>Conversion of NFA-Epsilon and NFA to DFA</li>
  <li>Conversion of Grammar to PDA</li>
  <li>Conversion of PDA to Grammar</li>
  
  <h4>The evaluation of a PDA coming from a Grammar to PDA conversion might take some time to work properly because of the evaluation algorithm used.</h4>
  
   <h4>Sadly the evaluation of a PDA->Grammar->PDA will not work.</h4>
</ul>
